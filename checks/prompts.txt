Side by side comparison
------------------------

Given the output of go test -bench with -benchmem, parse each benchmark line. 
Extract the benchmark name, operation (add, sub, mul, div), number type (Decimal or Numeric), 
input values (e.g., 1, 2), and benchmark results: time per operation (ns/op), bytes allocated (B/op), and heap allocations (allocs/op).

Group results by operation and input. 
Present the result as a markdown table comparing Decimal vs Numeric side-by-side with columns:

Op | Input A & B | Decimal ns/op | Numeric ns/op | Decimal B/op | Numeric B/op | Decimal allocs/op | Numeric allocs/op

Numeric only
